# Gulp starter stack

Base files adapted from [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/) responsive boilerplate
* normalize.min.css removed
* css/ folder becomes **sass/**, with new **app.sass** as the main sass file
* normalize.css renamed to **normalize.scss**, included in app.sass
* main.css modified to remove Initialzr styling, reinstated as **base.sass**

## Getting started:

```bash
npm install
bower install
gulp
```
